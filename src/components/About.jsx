        Hi there! I'm [Shuvo] â€” a passionate developer with a love for tech, logic, and creativity. 
        I'm currently pursuing my career in full-stack development, specializing in front-end design with React 
        and back-end development using Node.js and Python. 
        <br /><br />
        As a self-taught developer, I've built several projects independently to explore different technologies 
        and workflows. I love solving real-world problems through clean, scalable code.
        <br /><br />
        I'm always open to learning, collaborating, and improving. Let's connect!
      </p>
